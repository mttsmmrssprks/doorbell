This is a Rasbperry Pi-based doorbell.

It sets up a service to 'listen' for an input on GPIO pin 23. 

The circuit should be connected on GPIO 23 and ground on the RPi.

When the circuit is closed, it triggers a script that plays an audio file.

This is written for a Raspberry Pi Zero W with an Adafruit I2S DAC bonnet.

To add:
- links to components
- steps for setting up service
- steps for adding audio file
- add script to randomise audio files
